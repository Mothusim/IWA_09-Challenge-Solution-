# Tally counter

This is a simple tally counter web page that allows you to increment and decrement a displayed value. The counter has a minimum and maximum limit, and the corresponding buttons are disabled when the limits are reached.


## Features

- Increment and Decrement: The app allows users to increase or decrease the displayed value of the counter by clicking on the respective buttons.
- Value Limits: The counter has predefined limits to prevent the value from going beyond a specified range. The MAX_NUMBER constant defines the maximum value, and the MIN_NUMBER constant defines the minimum value.
- Disabled Buttons: When the counter reaches the maximum or minimum limit, the corresponding increment or decrement button is disabled to prevent further incrementing or decrementing.
- Counter Selection: The app includes a "Counter" dropdown menu that allows users to select different counter options. However, the functionality for handling this option is not implemented in the provided JavaScript code.
